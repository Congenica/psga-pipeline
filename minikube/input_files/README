Original input files are stored in: s3://synthetic-data-dev/UKHSA/data/fastq_run.tgz

Subsets of those files are stored here.

Subsample 10000 read pairs from two large paired FASTQ files (same seed to keep pairing)
```
seqtk sample -s100 read1.fq 10000 > read1.subset.fq
seqtk sample -s100 read2.fq 10000 > read2.subset.fq
```
