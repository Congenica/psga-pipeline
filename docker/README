# NOTES about LEGACY code.

There is a lot of duplication here in order to avoid enabling Jenkins from pulling the images from the new PSGA ECR for the time being.

When this will happen, we will need to change the following:

1. remove this file
2. update `jenkins/files/sars_cov_2/Jenkinsfile` so that it uses the new ECR repo AND uses `sars-cov-2-pipeline` instead of `psga-pipeline` as docker image for the Jenkins pod
3. update `psga/sars_cov_2/nextflow.config` so that is uses `sars-cov-2-pipeline` instead of `psga-pipeline` as docker image for the Jenkins pod
4. remove all `docker/Dockerfile.*-legacy` files
5. remove all references to legacy code in `.circleci/config.yml`, so that the legacy images are no longer build and pushed to Congenica ECR
