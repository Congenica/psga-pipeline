# Building notes:

To speed up the building of docker images, pangolin and ncov repositories are cloned externally in order to fetch the environment yaml files.
These yaml files are then copied to the docker image.
Similarly, the sars-cov-2 primer schemes are obtained locally and then copied over to the docker image.

Important files:
* sars_cov_2.deps : this contains the commits for upgrading ncov, pangolin and relevant data sets
* bash scripts : for cloning the repositories and fetching the primers
