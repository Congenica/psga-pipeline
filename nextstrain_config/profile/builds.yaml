# Here we can specify the colors file & auspice_config to be used for all of the
# above builds - unless otherwise specified in the builds above!
# If you don't specify these, the files in `default_config` folder will be used
files:
  colors: "/custom_profile/bahrain_colors.tsv"
  auspice_config: "/custom_profile/auspice_config_bahrain.json"

## You could also specify a title which will be used for all builds
## where you haven't already specified a title above:
## (Uncomment this to use!):
title: "SARS-CoV-2 Builds Focused on divisions of Bahrain"

## Finally, you can specify what traits you want to reconstruct, per build.
## If you have exposure information for a trait, specify it as well, so that
## this is incorporated into the final run. (Otherwise, it will simply be excluded)

## Specify the traits you want to reconstruct, per build:
traits:
  bahrain: # for the bahrain build
    columns: ["division"]

exposure:
  bahrain:
    trait: "country"
    exposure: "division_exposure"

## If you want to modify parameters for the steps in the build - augur commands -
## you can copy these from the 'defaults/parameters.yaml' file:
## Here are some examples below - uncomment if you want to use them:

## Modify filter settings. By default we filter out sequences less than 27000 bases
## If you wanted to include slightly shorter sequeces, change this:
#filter:
#  min_length: 25000

## TreeTime settings for the 'refine' rule. By default we exclude sequences more than
## 4 IQD from the root-to-tip vs clock regression. You can change this if you want to include
## more divergent sequences:
#refine:
#  clock_filter_iqd: 6

reference_node_name: "NC_045512.2"
refine:
  root: "NC_045512.2"
